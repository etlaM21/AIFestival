#### Locatioons
There are three locations:
1. Cinema

The cinema is the location where movies are shown. Duh :D

2. Neural Network

Neural network means a place to relax and chat. It's possible to sit and talk with other guests, grab a drink and something to eat.
It is also used for workshops and panel discussions.

3. Output

Output is the gallery space. Here canvases, digital and analog, and installations are shown.

#### Agenda

The submitted movies are grouped into selections and displaced as such. One movie can run multiple times in different selections. These selections are themed under one idea related to AI.

The workshops are open to any guests. Workshops are related to the topic of AI. Workshop ideas:
- Locally running stable diffusion and using Google Colab + intro to settings
- Prompt like a pro: How to write proper prompts and refine your output image.


Panel discussions are with a selected group of speakers in front of an audience. There is one panel discussion with some of the artists displaying works at the festival And another one with one or more experts in the field of art and/or AI. Panel dieas:
- Discussion about use of AI in art. Copyright problems, is it real art etc.
- Ethics of AI
- Incorporation of AI in an artist's workflow
- AI bias

### Submission evaluation

Two tiers:

1. AI-Production

Works where the final result is the direct output of an AI. Some tweaks are allowed, color correction, cropping etc., but the actual artwork is more or less the direct output of the AI used.

2. AI-Pre-Production

The AI's output was heavily altered afterwards. It's still the base of the artwork, but a human mind build on top of it afterwards.

# Festival of AI Art

## Introduction

The Filmuniversity Babelsberg in Potsdam will be hosting a one-day festival to showcase AI art. The festival aims to celebrate the use of AI in all forms of artistic expression, including films, artworks, and music. This festival will be a platform for artists to showcase their work and to engage in a discussion about the role of AI in the creative process.

The festival will highlight the ways in which AI is used to create new and innovative works, and how it can serve as a tool for artists to push the boundaries of what is possible. By focusing on the creative potential of AI, the festival hopes to shift the conversation away from debates about whether or not AI should be used in the arts, and instead to a discussion about how it can be used to create works that are meaningful and impactful.

With a lineup of some of the most innovative AI artists, the festival will provide a space for attendees to experience the cutting-edge of technology and the arts. Through workshops, panel discussions, and demonstrations, attendees will have the opportunity to learn about the latest developments in AI and its impact on the creative process.

This festival will be a unique and exciting opportunity to explore the relationship between AI and art, and to celebrate the many ways in which artists are using this powerful tool to create works that are truly innovative and thought-provoking. So mark your calendars and join us at the Filmuniversity Babelsberg in Potsdam to celebrate the intersection of AI and art.

## Structure

The one-day festival at the Filmuniversity Babelsberg in Potsdam will showcase AI art in two categories: AI DREAMS and AI MADE.

For the AI DREAMS category, artists are invited to submit works that are inspired by AI powered creations. This category is open to all forms of artistic expression, including movies, visuals, and installations, and the AIs used can range from image generators to text generators to pattern recognizers.

The AI MADE category is for works that have been created, at least partially, by AI. To submit for this category, artists must provide a detailed description of the role that AI played in the creation of their work, and all works must have a strong connection to the topic of AI used in the arts.

A committee will review all submissions to ensure that the works meet the criteria for exhibition. This will ensure that the festival showcases the best of AI art and celebrates the many ways in which artists are using AI to push the boundaries of what is possible in the arts.

So, if you're an artist working with AI, or just someone who is interested in the intersection of technology and art, be sure to submit your work to the festival and join us in celebrating the many ways in which AI is changing the face of the arts.
